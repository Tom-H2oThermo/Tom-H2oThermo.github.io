The H2o Thermodynamic Properties Excel Add-In program provides functions that provide the thermodynamic and transport properties for water and steam using the IAPWS (International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam) R7-97 (2012) industrial formulations. These properties are used extensively in various engineering fields including the steam turbine design and testing, boiler design and testing, geothermal power applications, the oil and gas industry, food processing, university courses, control system platforms, etc.

The basic thermodynamic properties, and their SI Units, are:  
• Pressure (P) in units of MPa  
• Temperature (T) in units of K (Kelvins)  
• Enthalpy (H) in units of kJ/kg  
• Entropy (S) in units of kJ/(kg·K)  
• Internal Energy (U) in units of kJ/kg  
• Specific Volume (Cp) in units of m<sup>3</sup>/kg  
• Constant Pressure Specific Heat (Cv) in units of kJ/(kg·K)  
• Constant Volume Specific Heat (Cv) in units of kJ/(kg·K)  
• Speed of Sound (W) m/s

An optional parameter allows for the use of US Customary, Metric bara or Metric kPa units of measure for these thermodynamic property functions.

In addition, the program provides 120 partial derivative functions for these thermodynamic properties, which are only available using SI units.

Refer to the [The Basics page](https://h2othermo.com/home-page/the_basics/) for detailed information on how to use the H2o Thermodynamic Properties Excel Add-In.

In addition, please refer to the [Primary Functions page](https://h2othermo.com/home-page/primary_functions/) for a list of all of the primary thermodynamic functions along with specific details on those individual functions.  Refer to the [Derivative Functions page](https://h2othermo.com/home-page/derivative_functions/) for a list of all of the functions that provide the partial derivatives of the thermodynamic properties.  The partial derivatives can be useful for uncertainty analysis, process modeling and for process optimization calculations.

**We hope you will find this Excel Add-In of great use and value**!
